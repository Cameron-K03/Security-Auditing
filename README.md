## **7. Scripts and Automation for Compliance**

**Document:** `SIEM-Data-Sorting.ps1`  
**Overview:**  
This PowerShell script demonstrates my developed automation capabilities. In this case, I've automated the sorting and management of data one would receive from Splunk or whatever their typical SIEM happens to be. It is an example of how I will utilize automation to be an effective worker, achieving more with less user input. I'll use my scripting capabilities to enhance compliance and security monitoring processes.

```powershell
